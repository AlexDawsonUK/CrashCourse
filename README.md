# A Crash Course in Mobile Web Design

These are the video files for a video course I taught on Learnable (now Sitepoint Premium) back in 2011.
The information is largely outdated due to the invention of responsive design, however it serves as an interesting historical note of how we used todo things before media queries existed so I thought I'd throw my successful course on GitHub for anyone who is interested!
